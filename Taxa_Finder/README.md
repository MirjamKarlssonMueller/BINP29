# Taxa Finder

## Necessary Files

<p>Two files are necessary to run Taxa_Finder.py: nodes.dmp and names.dmp. They are part of a collection of files, taxdump, uploaded by ncbi as a part of their taxonomy database.
They can be found in taxdump.tar.gz (or any other zipped format of taxdump) at:<p>

https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/

or downloaded directly over the console with:

wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz 

Make sure to unzip the files regardless of how you download them, and then save them in the same directory as Taxa_finder.py.


## Commands

<p> The script will take a query (or several) and return the lineage from the root of the taxonomic tree to the query (in case of several, for each query).
  
```shell
  
```
