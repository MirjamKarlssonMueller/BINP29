Title: Taxa_Finder_web.py
Date: 2022-03-14
Author: Mirjam Karlsson-MÃ¼ller

Description: Finds the taxonomy lineage of one or more query /queries in the ncbi 
taxonomy database. In case of two or more queries, can also return last common
taxonomic node. Uses Flask to create a webinterface.
    
    
List of functions:
    find_lineage: Finds lineage corresponding to a single query (string).
    Find_common: Finds last common taxonomic node between queries.
    
Procedure:
    1. Iterate through the queries, entered on the website, for each:
        a. The query is looked for in the file names.dmp, its corresponding ID
        is extracted. The scientific names and their corresponding IDs from names.dmp
        are saved.
        b. The script then looks for the query ID in the file nodes.dmp, finds the 
        corresponding parent ID, looks for that one in nodes.dmp, finds its parent
        ID etc until reaching the root of the taxonomic tree. The IDs are saved
        in a list.
        c. By going through the path list, the corresponding lineage is assembled
        into a string, one ID at the time. If input parameter -s or --short is given,
        then only nodes who are not marked as hidden by ncbi will be added to
        lineage. Additionally saved as dictionary together with query(-ies).
    2. If -c is set, then the resultng dictionary containing queries and lineages
    will be used to determine the last common node. And this is also added to the output.
    3. Output is printed in output file and/or console. The result is labelled with the query,
    to be able to distinguish the lineage. All results get printed in the same file.
    

Usage:
    Run in Flask environment with:
        python Taxa_Finder_web.py
                                    
    Then open test-environment url.
    
Possible Bugs:
    1. Requires files names.dmp and nodes.dmp in working directory.
    2. If neither -p or -o are given, the script runs, but no output is given.
    3. Requires Flask environment
