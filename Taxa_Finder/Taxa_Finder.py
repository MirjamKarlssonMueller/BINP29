Title: Taxa_Finder.py

Author: Mirjam Karlsson-MÃ¼ller

Description: Finds the taxonomy lineage of one or more query /queries in the ncbi 
taxonomy database.  
    
    
List of functions:
    find_lineage: Finds lineage corresponding to a single query (string).

    
Procedure:
    1. Iterate through the queries, for each:
        a. The query is looked for in the file names.dmp, its corresponding ID
        is extracted. The scientific names and their corresponding IDs from names.dmp
        are saved.
        b. The script then looks for the query ID in the file nodes.dmp, finds the 
        corresponding parent ID, looks for that one in nodes.dmp, finds its parent
        ID etc until reaching the root of the taxonomic tree. The IDs are saved
        in a list.
        c. By going through the path list, the corresponding lineage is assembled
        as a string, one ID at the time. If input parameter -s or --short is given,
        then only nodes who are not marked as hidden by ncbi will be added to
        lineage.
    2. Lineage is printed in output file and/or console. The result is labelled with the query,
    to be able to distinguish the lineage. All results get printed in the same file.
    

Usage:
    Run in command line with:
    
    python Taxa_Finder.py -i INPUT ... [-o] [OUTFILE] [-s] [-p]
    
    --input INPUT, -i INPUT:        Query name, as string.
    
    --out [OUTFILE], -o [OUTFILE]: Lineage printed into specified outputfile.
                                    If output file not specified, but -o given, then 
                                    default file "Lineage.txt" is created.
    
    --short, -s:                    The lineage returned will only include entries not 
                                    flagged as hidden in the ncbi database.
    
    --print, -p:                    The lineage returned is printed to console.
    
    Note that printing to console and printing to outfile are not mutually exclusive.
    Both can be done, or neither.
    
Possible Bugs:
    1. Requires files names.dmp and nodes.dmp in working directory.
    2. If neither -p or -o are given, the script runs, but no output is given.
